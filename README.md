# Closest Pair Identifier for N-dimensions

Java based solution for the closest point pair in N-dimensions.
Not full solution.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Install maven tool for Java

```
sudo apt-get install maven
```

Install OpenJDK-8

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the git repo

```
git clone https://github.com/rjulius23/mysolution.git
```

Build the package using Maven

```
cd <repo path>
mvn clean package
```

Run the generated jar file which has "jar-with-dependencies" in its name

```
java -jar target/closest-pair-identifier-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <input file path>
```

Usage:

```
E.g.: java -cp mySolution.jar <input file path>
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
